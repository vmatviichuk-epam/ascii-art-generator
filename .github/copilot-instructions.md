### When working with this project, always perform the following actions:
- never remove any Splunk-related files
- only use black, white and red colors when working with GUI. 
- track all changes by adding them in changes.md file so that code reviewer can review them faster. Changes should be one-two lines maximum
- always prefer using `sh` over making files executable when running shell scripts
- color schema constants should be defined in a separate place and reused always via references.
- when doing code review follow instructions in docs/code review instructions.md file
